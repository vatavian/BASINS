BASINS is a large system I worked on for many years at AQUA TERRA Consultants, now a division of RESPEC.<p>
BASINS uses GIS for viewing maps of a study area, for processing data that is provided as map layers into environmental model inputs, and for viewing model outputs.<p>
Environmental models are designed to predict how changes to an area (such as development near rivers or a changing climate) 
might change water quality or contribute to flooding or drought. BASINS works with more than one model. Some models are legacy FORTRAN or C++ code, others are written in more modern languages like R and Python.<p>
For an example, see the following publication in which I am credited as co-author:<br>
<i>Using the Climate Assessment Tool (CAT) in U.S. EPA BASINS Integrated Modeling System to Assess Watershed Vulnerability to Climate Change</i> 2007 Water Science and Technology https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17978432/<p>
One major focus of mine was collecting necessary data (automatically downloading map layers, rainfall, census, land use, etc.) for the area of interest from a variety of websites. I was primarily responsible for the design and implementation of the data download functionality, a library named D4EM (Data for Environmental Modeling) which has also been used by internal EPA projects.<p>
I am credited as co-author of a paper for working closely with people at NASA to get them to implement an API for retrieving satellite data as a series of values for a particular location instead of only as a map of the whole country for one moment in time: <p>
<i>Bridging the Gap between NASA Hydrological Data and the Geospatial Community</i> Feb 11, 2011, American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110008139<p>
Another focus of my work was making the huge amount of data generated by models visible using reports, maps, and graphs.<p>
I was involved in the decision when the BASINS team decided to adopt the open source MapWindow GIS: https://github.com/MapWindow<br>
There was some pressure to use a proprietary GIS, but we decided that we wanted all stakeholders to be able to freely download and use our system without costly licensing.<p>
We published a paper about our use of MapWindow GIS:<br>
<i>BASINS 4.0: Expanding Capabilities in an Open GIS Framework</i> Mar 17, 2008 AWRA Spring Specialty Conference: GIS and Water Resources V https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251562530_BASINS_40_Expanding_Capabilities_in_an_Open_GIS_Framework<p>
MapWindow GIS is largely the work of others, but I did some C# work on it, helping to extend its capabilities as needed for BASINS.<p>
